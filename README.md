Image Captioning Using AI
This project leverages deep learning to generate captions for images. Using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for extracting image features and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTMs for generating text descriptions, the system provides automatic image captions.
